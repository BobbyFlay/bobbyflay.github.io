My first website development project using X-Theme Pro from Wordpress. Quickly became a theme power user, teaching myself HTML, CSS, and a little bit of PHP and Javascript along the we. X-Theme asked me to guest post on their website. [Read my article for X-Theme](https://theme.co/blog/how-switching-to-x-theme-helped-us-double-traffic-boost-lead-generation-strengthen-our-brand/).
