As Director of Marketing at AdHawk, I led 8 website development projects using my own hands, in-house and contracted engineering resources. 

My experience ranges from free lead generation tools, wordpress blogs, HTML landing pages, core website themes, referral programs and content marketing funnels and landing pages. 

## Examples: 
ETA Tool | tryadhawk.com | FlooringStores.com Blog | AdHawk Academy  | Audit Tool

## Results: 
Our BOFU product & managed services landing pages converted at 17%, 5.6x the industry average

Our TOFU landing pages average a 46% conversion rate
